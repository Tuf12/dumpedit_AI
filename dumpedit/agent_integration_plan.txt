# DumpEdit AI Agent Integration Plan

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Enhance DumpEdit text editor with intelligent file naming using a custom RL agent called "Agent Byte" that learns from user feedback to generate contextually relevant filenames.

## Current DumpEdit Functionality

- Simple text editor with auto-save to single file (`dumpedit_notes.txt`)
- User workflow: clear → paste content → send file → repeat
- Problem: Generic filename provides no context to recipients

## Desired Functionality

**Core Behavior:**
- Agent analyzes pasted content and generates meaningful filename
- File automatically renames with each content change
- Agent learns from user feedback to improve naming over time
- Single file system maintained (no multiple files)

## Agent Integration Architecture

### Agent: "Agent Byte v1.2"
- **Type:** Enhanced modular RL agent with dual brain architecture (neural + symbolic)
- **Core Components:**
  - **Neural Network:** PyTorch-based Dueling DQN with Double DQN improvements
  - **Symbolic Knowledge:** Context-aware decision making with environmental adaptation
  - **Adaptive Learning:** Environment-specific parameter optimization (gamma, learning rate)
- **Input:** Raw text content from editor
- **Output:** Generated filename string
- **Integration:** Copy agent_byte.py, dual_brain_system.py, knowledge_system.py into project
- **Learning:** Modular design with knowledge system for rapid adaptation

### Data Storage
- **Neural Networks:** PyTorch PTH files (agent_main_network.pth, agent_target_network.pth)
- **Knowledge System:** JSON files (agent_brain.json, agent_knowledge.json)
- **Training Logs:** JSON files (agent_matches.json - keeps last 3 matches to optimize file size)
- **Filename Training:** New JSON for filename-specific learning
- **Logged Data:**
  - Content type detected (email, code, meeting notes, etc.)
  - Symbolic markers identified
  - Environmental context used
  - Generated filename and user feedback
  - Adaptive learning parameters applied
- **Existing Architecture:**
  - Dual brain system with 15,000+ network parameters
  - Symbolic decision maker with strategy effectiveness tracking
  - Environment-specific knowledge contexts

## User Interface Enhancements

### Visual Elements
- **Window Title:** `DumpEdit - filename.txt` (shows current filename)
- **Feedback Buttons:** Thumbs up (+) and thumbs down (-) symbols
- **Manual Override:** Type `title: new name` on first line of editor

### User Workflow
1. User pastes content into editor
2. Agent analyzes content and generates filename
3. Window title updates to show new filename
4. User provides feedback:
   - **Positive:** Click thumbs up OR open/use file (implicit approval)
   - **Negative:** Click thumbs down OR type `title: new name`
5. Agent receives reward/penalty and learns

## Reward System Design

### Positive Rewards
- User clicks thumbs up/+ button
- User opens/uses file with agent-generated name (implicit approval)

### Negative Rewards
- User clicks thumbs down/- button
- User types `title: new name` override on first line

### Special Cases
- **Agent modifies text content:** Big negative reward (shouldn't happen)
- **Multiple thumbs down:** Agent generates new name each time (no retry limit)
- **Agent failure:** User keeps current filename or uses manual override

## Agent Byte v1.2 Integration Specifics

### Existing Agent Capabilities
- **Dual Brain Architecture:** Neural network + symbolic knowledge system
- **Experience Buffer:** 5000-item deque for experience replay
- **User Demo Learning:** Can learn from human demonstrations with quality scoring
- **Environment Integration:** Modular design for environment-specific behavior
- **Adaptive Parameters:** Automatic gamma/learning rate optimization per environment
- **Knowledge System:** Symbolic lessons, strategies, and reflections with effectiveness tracking

### Filename Generation Environment Setup
The agent will treat filename generation as a new "environment" with:
- **State:** Text content features (length, type, keywords, structure)
- **Actions:** Different filename generation strategies
- **Rewards:** User feedback (thumbs up/down, manual override)
- **Environment Context:**
  - Objective: Generate contextually relevant filenames
  - Learning parameters: Optimized for immediate feedback
  - Strategic concepts: Text analysis, keyword extraction, pattern recognition

### Integration Approach
1. **Create FilenameEnvironment class** - Wrapper to interface with existing agent
2. **Text Analysis Module** - Convert raw text to state representation for agent
3. **Action Space** - Define filename generation strategies (title extraction, keyword-based, etc.)
4. **Reward System** - Map user feedback to agent's existing reward structure

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Agent Environment Adaptation
1. **Create FilenameEnvironment class** - Interface between dumpedit and Agent Byte
2. **Text Analysis Pipeline** - Convert text content to state features
3. **Action Space Definition** - Map agent actions to filename strategies:
   - Extract title/header
   - Keyword-based naming
   - Content type detection
   - Pattern recognition
4. **Reward Mapping** - Connect user feedback to agent's reward system

### Phase 2: Agent Integration
1. Copy core agent files (agent_byte.py, dual_brain_system.py, knowledge_system.py)
2. Create filename-specific knowledge context
3. Set up adaptive learning parameters for filename environment
4. Initialize agent with filename generation "app context"

### Phase 3: UI and Workflow Updates
1. Add filename display to window title
2. Implement thumbs up/down feedback buttons
3. Add manual override detection (`title: name` parsing)
4. Connect save triggers to agent analysis pipeline

### Phase 4: Learning System Integration
1. Integrate with existing JSON logging (agent_matches.json pattern)
2. Set up filename-specific training data collection
3. Configure symbolic knowledge system for text analysis patterns
4. Test agent learning with real usage scenarios

## Fallback Mechanisms

### Agent Unavailable/Crashed
- Keep current filename (whatever file is currently named)
- Allow manual override with `title: new name` syntax
- Log error for debugging

### Poor Name Generation
- User can always override with `title: new name`
- Multiple thumbs down attempts allowed
- Agent learns from all negative feedback
