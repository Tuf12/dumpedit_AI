## Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. **Paste/Type Content**: Agent Byte analyzes content in real-time
2. **AI Processing**: 
   - Predicts content category (code, email, documentation, etc.)
   - Generates contextual filename using learned strategies
   - Updates window title with new filename
3. **Provide Feedback**: 
   - üëç **Good**: Click if filename is appropriate
   - üëé **Poor**: Click to see alternatives or provide correct name
   - **Alternatives**: Choose from AI-generated options
   - **Category Review**: Confirm or correct content categorization

### Manual Override
Type on the first line:
```
title: your_custom_filename
```
The agent learns from this override as negative feedback.

### AI Learning Features

#### Filename Generation
The AI uses multiple strategies:
- **Code Identifiers**: Extracts class/function names from code
- **Email Subjects**: Uses subject lines for email content
- **Error Analysis**: Identifies error types and context
- **Metadata Extraction**: Finds timestamps, file references
- **Descriptive Generation**: Creates meaningful names from content analysis

#### Content Categorization
Agent Byte recognizes and learns:
- Code (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Email/Communication
- Documentation/Notes
- Error logs/Debug info
- Meeting notes
- Configuration files
- And more through user feedback

#### Dual Learning System
- **Filename Learning**: Reinforces successful naming strategies (+2.0 reward)
- **Category Learning**: Improves content classification (+1.5 reward)
- **User Teaching**: Learns from manual corrections (-1.5 penalty, but gains knowledge)
- **Combined Bonus**: Extra reward when both filename and category are correct (+0.5)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **AI Not Working**: Check if all Python files are in the same directory
- **No Feedback Buttons**: Ensure agent_byte.py and related files are present
- **Poor Filenames**: Provide feedback to help the agent learn your preferences

- `agent_matches.json` for training session details

### Reset Learning
To reset the AI learning:
1. Delete `agent_brain.json`, `agent_knowledge.json`
2. Delete `agent_main_network.pth`, `agent_target_network.pth`
3. Restart the application
